## Logarithmic Regret for Online Control

## Introduction

- Regret

  - For general convex losses, $O(\sqrt t)$;
  - For losses functions exhibit more curvature, such as quadratic function, $O(poly(log(t)))$;

- In this paper we give the first effecient poly-logarithmic algorithm for strongly convex loss function problem;
