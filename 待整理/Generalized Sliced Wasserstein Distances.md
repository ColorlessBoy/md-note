# Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Distances

## Abstract

- Sliced-Wasserstein distance (?)
- This paper's works:
  - mathematical connection between the SW distance and the Radon transform;
  - Generalized slice Wasserstein distances;
  - GSW can extends to max-GSW; (?)
  - The conditions under which GSW and max-GSW distances are indeed distances;
  - Numerical performance.

## Introduction

- **Problem**: high computational complexity;
- **Contributions**:
  - GSW: replacing linear projections with polynomial projections;
  - Max-GSW: instead of infinitely many projections with single projection;
  - Result: reduce the overall computational burden in a significant amount.
